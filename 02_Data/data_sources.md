# Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification** dataset, available on Kaggle.

- **Dataset Name:** Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification) 
 
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains sensor readings from manufacturing machines, collected under various operating conditions. Each record includes multiple sensor measurements along with a label indicating whether the machine is operating normally or is at risk of failure. The dataset is designed to facilitate predictive maintenance modeling by providing real-world sensor data and failure indicators.
