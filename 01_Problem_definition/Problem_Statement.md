# Problem Statement

Predictive maintenance aims to forecast when manufacturing equipment is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed just in time to prevent unexpected breakdowns. This approach minimizes downtime, reduces maintenance costs, and improves overall operational efficiency.

In this project, we use sensor data from manufacturing machines to predict potential failures before they occur. The goal is to build a reliable classification model that can identify the likelihood of machine failure based on real-time sensor readings.

# Objective

- Develop a predictive model that accurately classifies machine states into normal operation or failure risk.
- Use historical sensor data to identify patterns and early warning signs of machine degradation.
- Enable proactive maintenance scheduling to reduce unplanned downtime and increase equipment lifespan.
- Provide actionable insights to maintenance teams through model interpretation.

# Challenges

- Handling imbalanced data, since failure events are often rare compared to normal operation.
- Dealing with noisy or missing sensor data that could affect model accuracy.
- Extracting meaningful features from multivariate time-series sensor data.
- Ensuring the model generalizes well to new, unseen machines or operating conditions.
- Integrating predictive maintenance predictions into existing manufacturing workflows.
