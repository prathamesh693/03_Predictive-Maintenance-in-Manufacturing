# Project Description

This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance solution for manufacturing machines using the **Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains sensor readings collected from machines operating under different conditions, with labeled instances indicating normal and failure states.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to identify early warning signs of machine failure, enabling maintenance teams to perform timely interventions and reduce costly unplanned downtime.

# Project Lifecycle

1. **Data Collection & Understanding:** Acquire and explore the dataset, understand feature distributions, missing data, and class imbalance.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, normalize sensor readings, and engineer features if necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize sensor trends, correlations, and failure patterns.
4. **Model Building:** Train classification models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or neural networks.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Model Interpretation:** Analyze feature importance and validate predictions with domain knowledge.
7. **Deployment & Monitoring (Optional):** Package the model for real-time prediction and monitor its performance over time.
